# The data collection set



# Excercise 1:

a) We've got the list of patients we want to extract a list of
patients that are assigned to _pediatrics_ specialty.

b) We want to narrow down that list to patients assigned to
_pediatrics_ and _age_ below 10 years old.

# Excercise 2:

We want to activate the urgency protocol if any of the patients
hear rate are great than XXX or temperature is greater than 39 Celsius.

# Excercise 3:

The Pediatrician could not attend today the patients: We want to reassign patients assigned to _pediatrics_ specialty to
_general medicine_

# Excercise 4

We want to know if we can send the Pediatrician home (no patients today),
check if any patient is assigned to _pediatrics_

# Excercise 5:

We want to calculate the total of patients that are assigned
to general medicine and the number of patients that are assigned
to pediatrics.
